# pygame-self-education

Russ wants to know how to use Pygame effectively, to create interesting, interactive programs.  So I'm going to be playing around with little micro-games here: some of them may be tutorials that I find on the web; some may be duplicates of classic games, like Minesweeper.  The point of this is not to create innovative games, but simply to build my own skill.  But feel free to post ideas, or to help me improve them!
